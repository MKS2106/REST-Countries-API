## Overview
 This Project allows user browse all the the countries, search countries by name, filter countries by region, disaply detailed information about each country and click through the border countries.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.
Your users should be able to:
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascripr(Vanilla)
- REST Countries API

###  What I Learned
- This projet required me to do lot of research on finding and using correct endpoints givign an opportunity to explore and more abou API Calls and using API responses.
- I was able to put my javascript skills that I learned so far to a test which allowed me to understand dynamic HTML content creation and other  in depth. 

### How to Run
- Clone the repository
- Open Index.html
- Click on any country 
- Search for any country
- Filter countries by region

### Continued Development
- Add Dark Mode toggle

- Special thanks to my instructors for their guidance, encouragement and support
- Thanks to the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) team for providing a fantastic data source.

### Reflection
Through out this project, I gained valuable experience in working with external APIs and managing asynchronous data fetching using JavaScript's fetch API and async/await syntax. I also learned how to handle API responses gracefully using try/catch blocks and how to manipulate and display data dynamically in the DOM. Implementing search and region filtering further enhanced my understanding of array manipulation using JavaScript methods like .filter() and .includes(), .join, .map. 
One of the more technical lessons involved managing page navigation and state. When a user clicks on a country, the selected data is stored in localStorage and used to populate a separate detail page. On that page, detailed information such as native name, population, region, capital, top-level domain, currencies, and languages is displayed. Additionally, users can view and click on neighboring countries listed as buttons.
Throughout this process, I benefited greatly from the support and guidance of my instructors and peers. Their feedback was instrumental in improving the code structure, simplifying logic, and addressing edge cases. Working with others also gave me insight into how to build more user-friendly and efficient applications.
Iâ€™m proud of what I accomplished. The application is interactive, visually clean, and functionally complete for its scope.
